**Overview;** Welcome! My name is McLean, and this is CodeCourse! In this course, you are going to build real life websites with Html and Css. I already assume that you know at least the basic syntax of the languages since this is not a course on the languages themselves, rather, how to apply them in real life projects. 

**Course Structure;** The course is project based meaning that I won’t load you down with many tiny little assignments. I’m going to assign you 5 or 6 websites to work through. There’s no due dates for any of the singular assignments; you don’t even have to do all 6, you can pick and choose. however, all of the websites you do  have to get handed in by **June 1st.** Even this is flexible depending on timing. 

**What If I Don’t Know Html And Css?**  As I already discussed in the overview, I already assume you already know these languages. Is this a obstacle? Absolutely not!! I’ll provide some tutorials in case you need a recap or you are new. I’ll also assign a more simple website for you to work through. 

**Software And Tools;** The course is hosted on Google Classroom. All of our projects and resources will be posted there. 

**Additional tools will be listed below** 

- A Web browser ( Google Chrome, Brave, ETC) 
- VS Code
  - Live Server
- Github and Netlify 

**Class Github Repository;** All of the finished code will be posted there separated by branches. So if you get stuck at any point you can check my code against your code and debug. 

**Marking;** Each site you complete is worth **40 marks**.  20 marks goes towards the actual website design itself, the other 20 goes towards the source code that powers the website. For the code  I look for consistent comments throughout your code for readability I look at syntax, I am looking for the proper use of semantic Html tags. DO NOT use divs for everything.  

As far as the website design. I’m looking for pleasant aesthetics, good contrast, typography and colour use on the website. If it is not up to standard and I feel either your code or the website design needs improvement, I will actually hand it back to you and give you feedback on what needs improvement and you can fix it, hand it back in and I will re-evaluate it. 

**Getting in touch;** If you ever need to reach out to ask a question or you need help with your code, you can always email me. My email address is written at the top of the outline. Also, there is a support branch on the github repository, you can open a pull request and contact me through that.
